### Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

I created machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I compared the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier model.

#### Retrieve the Data

The data is located in the Challenge Files Folder:

* `lending_data.csv`

I imported the data using Pandas and displayed the resulting dataframe to confirm the import was successful.

#### Predict Model Performance

I created and compared two models on this data: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier.

I predicted that the Logistic Regression model would perform better.

#### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

I then stored the features into dataframe `X`, and stored the "loan_status" column as the labels set as `y`. I split the data into training and testing datasets by using the `train_test_split` function.

#### Create, Fit and Compare Models

After creating a Logistic Regression and RFC models, I fit it to the training data. I then determined the model's score by using the `score` function and the testing data.
